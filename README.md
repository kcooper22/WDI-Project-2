DIDIT - A (Personal) Project Management App

DIDIT lets a user keep track of the projects they are working on with associated tasks for each project. The app uses Rails to build pretty much everything with Skeleton.css providing much of the styling. The app uses nested routes in order to assist in creating the associations between projects and tasks.

Technologies include:

Devise - for log in services

Skeleton - for styling


Unfinished features: -making the logo clickable. Attempted to do this via form a tags, but altered styling of the text. Didn't have time to build a jpeg to make this doable.  -ability to add other users to a project. Couldn't figure out in time how to pull information (an email) from a form field and query it against the users table.
